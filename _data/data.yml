      - role: Senior Scientist, Machine Learning
        time: 2022 - 2024
        company: Exact Sciences, Madison, WI [remote]
        details: |
            Responsible for developing machine learning pipelines for the multi-cancer early detection product including a framework for processing and modeling multimodal biological and demographic data for large clinical cohorts.
            - Developed a multimodal machine learning classifier which will be deployed for a laboratory developed test in a real-world evidence setting.
            - Developed a Python package adopted by cross-functional teams that serves as a one-stop-shop for high-quality, reusable implementations of everyday tasks in the machine learning life cycle.
            - Defined a decision threshold framework for the multi-cancer early detection machine learning classifier.
            - Mentor other data scientists.

      - role: Senior Data Scientist, Team Lead
        time: 2020 - 2022
        company: DataRobot, Washington, DC
        details: |
            Led a team of data scientists responsible for development, execution, and delivery of machine learning models and data science applications for government public health agencies.
            - My team was responsible for all data science deliverables on a $5M contract, including data engineering, analysis, and visualization. 
            - We were also responsible for continuous deployment of a time series forecasting application for COVID-19.
            - Developed an application to assist a state government agency to decide which counties to distribute Naloxone, such that it would have the highest impact. Implemented the solution by studying peer-reviewed literature, statistical modeling, and linear programming.

      - role: Senior Data Scientist
        time: 2018 - 2020
        company: GeneDx, Gaithersburg, MD
        details: |
            I was a project lead on the data science team. I established the direction for publications, application development, and deployment.
            - Built a gradient-boosted decision tree model to predict the likelihood of identifying a molecular diagnosis in a patient. Trained on phenotypes from 46,314 patients, it achieved 0.42 average precision (random = 0.26) on a held-out test set of 9,336 patients. 
            - Implemented named entity recognition (NER) using natural language processing (NLP) tools to reduce the amount of time genetic counselors spent abstracting patient phenotypes from pdfs by 20%.
            - Developed the first publicly-available software at GeneDx. It quantifies the semantic similarity between two or more sets of phenotypes. It has been deployed to reduce the number of genetic variants for manual review by 18%: github.com/genedx/phenopy

            Lead the study design, data analysis, and publication of an ovarian cancer case-control study. Logistic regression was performed to quantify the association of genetic variants with ovarian cancer.
            - Set prices for complex genetic tests using linear optimization.
            - Primary data analyst role on several abstracts and publications.
